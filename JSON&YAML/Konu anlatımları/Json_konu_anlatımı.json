#What It Is:  JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a minimal, 
#readable format for structuring data.
#It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application.
#
#JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
#JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page
#JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

{
"employees":[
    {"firstName":"JOHN","lastName":"MC"},
    {"firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"A"},
    {"firstName":"James","lastName":"G"},
    {"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"A"},
    {"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"W"},
]
}


#Syntax Rules
#
#Data is in name/value pairs.
#: (colon) to separate name from value.
#Data is separated by , (commas) .
#Curly braces ( { and } ) hold objects.
#Square brackets ( [and ] )hold arrays.



#It starts with { (left brace) and ends with } (right brace).
#This particular example contains 3 keys â€“ country, capital, 
#and continent.
#Each key is followed by : (colon) and its respective value. 
#We separate the key/value pairs by , (comma).

Example:

{ "name" : "John"}

{
    "Country": "US",
    "Capital" : "Washington",
    "Continent": "North America"
}


#Example of Array:
#
#It starts with [ (left bracket), ends with ] (right bracket)
#the items are separated by , comma, similar to the dictionary.

[
    "Japan",
    "Austraia",
    "Canada"

]


#- Interview Q&A
#Q: What is the rule for JSON syntax rules?
#A: JSON syntax is a set of the JavaScript object notation syntax.
#
#Data is in name/value pairs
#Data is separated by comma
#Curly brackets hold objects
#Square bracket holds arrays


In JSON, values must be one of the following data types:

a string
{"name":"John"}

a Number
{ "age": 30}

an object (JSON object)
{
"employee":{ "name":"John", "age":40, "city":"Virginia" }
}

an array
{
"employee":["John","Aaron","James","Oliver","Walter"]
}

a boolean
{"Pass":true}

null
{"middlename":null}



Avoid ! : JSON values cannot be one of the following data types:
a function
a date
undefined


- Interview Q&A
Q: What are the data types supported by JSON?
A:Data types supported by JSON includes

Number
String
Boolean
Array
Object (JSON object)
Null



#JSON is built on two structures:
#
#A collection of name/value pairs.
#An ordered list of values. In most languages, 
#this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.


In JSON, they take on these forms:

1.An object is an unordered set of name/value pairs.
An object begins with `{` left brace and ends with `}` right brace. 
Each name is followed by `:` colon and the name/value pairs are separated 
by `,`comma.

{"FirstName":"serdar", "LastName":"serdengecti"}



2. An array is an ordered collection of values. An array begins with `[` 
left bracket and ends with `]` right bracket. Values are separated by `,` comma.

"employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"MC"},
    {"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"W"}
]



A value can be a string in double quotes, or a number, or true or false or null, 
or an object or an array. These structures can be nested.


Interview Q&A
Q: What is JSON objects?
A: An object can be defined as an unordered set of name/value pairs.
An object in JSON starts with {left brace} and finish or ends with {right brace}. 
Every name is followed by: (colon) and the name/value pairs are parted by, (comma).

    "json": [
        "rigit",
        "better for data interchange"
    ],
    "yaml" : [
        "slim and flexible",
        "better for configuration"
    ],
    "object": {
        "key":"value",
        "array": [

            {
                "boolean":true
            },
