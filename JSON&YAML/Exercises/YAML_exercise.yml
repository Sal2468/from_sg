#All YAML files can optionally begin 
#with --- and end with .... This is part of the
# YAML format and indicates the start and end of a document.

Example:

---
# A list of courses
- AWS
- DevOps
- Web Developer
... 


#A dictionary is represented in a simple key: value
# form (the colon must be followed by a space):

# Courses 
AWS:
    name: AWS Course
    job: Developer
    level: Advance


#More complicated data structures are possible, such as lists of dictionaries,
#dictionaries whose values are lists or a mix of both:

# Employee records

Indentation of YAML
#YAML does not include any mandatory spaces. Further,
# there is no need to be consistent. The valid YAML 
# indentation is shown below

a:
   b:
      - c
      -  d
      - e
f:
      "ghi"

#There are two styles which we can write our YAML;
#
#Block Styles : The block style is the YAML that you've 
#probably seen before and are somewhat familiar with. It's 
#the less compact and often indented traditional YAML that
#makes it easy for us humans to look at the file,
#1.Less Compact
#2.Better for Humans
