5. Try step-4 within the /bin directory
6. Execute sleep 200 in background (do not wait for it to finish).
7. Remove the file file55. Your command line should print 'success' if file55 is removed, and print 'failed' if there was a problem.
8. Use echo to display:
  "Hello "strange" 'characters' \a * [ } ~ \"

------------------------------------------
Example4 (shell variables)(INTERMEDIATE):

1. Use echo to display Hello followed by your username. (use a bash variable!)
2. Create a variable "myCase1" with a value of "Not exported".
3. Create a variable "myCase2" using export with a value of "Exported".
4. List all current shell variables and check if myCase1 and myCase2 exist
5. List all exported shell variables and check if myCase1 and myCase2 exist
6. Try to display  myCase1 and myCase2 in a new interactive child shell. 
7. Display your path vairable
8. Add ~/test/script directory to your path.

------------------------------------------
Example-5 (Bash Scripting) (INTERMEDIATE):
Create a script which gets a number from the user and prints whether the value is bigger or smaller than/equal to 10.

---------------------------------
Example-6 (User Management) (INTERMEDIATE):
1. Create a user account named clarus1, including a home directory and a description (or comment) that reads "Clarusway Account Number1" in one single command using "useradd" 
2. Create a user named clarus2, including home directory, bash shell, a description that reads "Clarusway Account Number2" in one single command using "useradd" 
3. Create a user named "clarus3" using "adduser" 
4. Verify that both users have correct entries in /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow and /etc/group. 
5. Verify that their home directory was created.
6. Create a file named welcome.txt and make sure every new user will see this file in their home directory. Create a new user clarus4, including a home directory using "useradd" and verify welcome.txt in the home directory.
7. Change the default login shell for the clarus4 user to any other shell. Verify before and after you make this change.
8. Set the password for clarus1 to 123.
9. Remove clarus1 user with its home directory.

------------------------------------
Example-7 (filters)(HIGH-INTERMEDIATE):

1. Make a list of all filenames in /etc that contain the string conf in their filename.
2. Make a sorted list of all files in /etc that contain the case insensitive string conf in their filename.
3. Get bash users info and save it in a file in home directory
4. Write the number of bash users.
5. Only get bash usernames  and sort them.
6. Find all files with .conf extension within maximum directory depth of 3. Case isn't important. View the results page by page with dynamic load.
